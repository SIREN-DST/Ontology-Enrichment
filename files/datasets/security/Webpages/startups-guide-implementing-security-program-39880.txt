Abstract

Startups struggle to balance survival with the practical implementation of a security program.
There are numerous obstacles facing founders who want to generate a solid security foundation,
including limited cash, lack of support from investors or the board, and conflicting priorities such
as generating revenue. Despite these obstacles, customers and potential customers continue to
demand a base level of security controls. This drive from customers, especially enterprise
customers, for solid security programs has forced startups to develop a practical approach to
security that works within the boundaries of their constraints. Implementation of key controls
and processes can establish a solid security foundation and meet the needs of customers.

1. Introduction

ns

This paper is based on both Vanessa’s eighteen years of experience in security and

ai

interviews she conducted with six Founders/CEOs. Additionally, she has been working as an

et

advisor to various startups for the past six years. Vanessa has mainly advised startups in the

rR

technology space, and one of those startups is currently a unicorn. Additionally, she joined a

ho

Venture Capital (VC) firm in 2018 as a venture partner and assists with investment due diligence
focusing on Security, Risk, Compliance, and Privacy.

,A

ut

Throughout her career, she has heard security practitioners express frustration and
disapproval of the lack of the attention that startups have paid to security. As a security

itu

te

professional, she was confused by the lack of focus startups gave to the security of their product
and company operations. It wasn’t until she started to work with startups and understand the

In

st

challenges they faced that she began to understand this lack of focus. She realized the root cause
was not a lack of desire to focus on security; it was a desire to survive that drove their actions.

NS

During her work with startups, she developed a set of minimum requirements in security

SA

processes and controls required to ensure the startup’s future success. This paper codifies

2. Overview of the startup community

A major concern for startups is raising money to fund the operations. There are several

ns

options for startups to raise money, and those options generally fall into the categories of debt

ai

(loans) or equity (shares of stock). Banks are a common source for debt, and Angel Investors and

rR

et

VCs are a common source of cash in exchange for equity. Typically, Angels (Seed Investors) are
high net worth individuals who invest in the very early stages of a company, often before a VC

ho

invests in exchange for some equity. VCs typically manage a pool of money on behalf of various

ut

organizations such as Foundations, Pension Funds, Wealthy Families, and Insurance companies.

,A

Since most startups are not generating cash, and most banks do not want to take on a startup’s

te

risk in the form of a loan, Angels/VCs are a common source of funds. As was mentioned above,

itu

investing in startups is very risky. For every ten companies, a VC invests in, five will fail, two to

st

three will return some modest multiple (2 to 4 times) of the initial investment, and one to two

In

will be a wild success. Basically, there is a 10% to 20% chance of making anywhere from 10 to

NS

100 times what was invested by the VC.

SA

When deciding which company to invest in, VCs consider three main factors: 1) the
people and the team, 2) the product, and 3) the market size for the product. Once a VC has

Th

e

decided to invest in a company, they will likely get a seat on the private company’s board. The
Board of a company is a group of individuals who have responsibilities that provide overall

20

strategic guidance and direction to the company leaders, primarily the CEO/Founder. The Board

©

20

also has the important role of evaluating the performance of the CEO. If the Founder does not
have a controlling interest (own at least 51% of the company’s equity), the Board could fire the
CEO. Because of the relationship between the Board and the CEO/Founder, the VC/Investor has
a great influence relative to the company and its priorities.
Different VCs have different styles relative to “overseeing” their investment. Vanessa has
worked with VCs who are very hands-on and will dive deep in problem-solving with its
leadership. Other VCs are very hands-off and just want to see the numbers and results.
Regardless of style, all VCs are motivated by the same principle, which is to maximize the
returns on their investment. Due to this motivation, they are far more concerned about sales and
selling into the target market than they are about security. Most VCs are not very technical, or
their technical knowledge is stale, having been away from an operating role for some extended

period of time. Security can be a very complex topic that is not easy to explain to an audience at

Fu

ll

the board/investor level. Additionally, unless a direct correlation can be made between security
and sales, there will be little interest in security by the Board.

ns

This disinterest by VC/Investors/Board members creates a challenge for a startup that has

et

ai

aspirations to build a strong security culture and the associated technical controls. Investors may

rR

challenge initiatives relative to security as they may not view allocating funds to security as a
good use of funds. This challenge creates friction between security-minded Founders and their

Investors.

3. The struggle of the startup – why security is not a priority

st

Based on Vanessa's experiences working with startups in the early phases, they often

In

have priorities other than security. They are focused on growing revenues, capturing marquee

NS

customer brands, and ensuring that they can make payroll and continue to retain their most
valued employees to drive product enhancements.

SA

Vanessa believes there are two main reasons security is not considered as a top priority

e

with startups. One relates to the priorities of customers, and the other relates to Maslow’s

Th

hierarchy of needs. In 1943, Abraham Maslow published a paper in Psychological Review

20

entitled, “A Theory of Human Motivation.” As a result of his paper, the pyramid of human needs

©

20

was developed as pictured below.

st

To summarize Maslow's hierarchy of needs, a human being can not focus on the areas

In

above its current state until the needs of that current state are met. If we start at the very base of

NS

the model, if a human being does not have enough food to survive, then they will take incredible

SA

risks to obtain that food and will not focus on the needs related to security or anything above
security. Psychologically and physiologically, the human needs to focus and put all his/her

Th

e

energy into survival.

An organization and, more specifically, a startup organization are no different. As seen

20

from the previous section, startups are focused on survival. They are worried about meeting

©

20

payroll and having enough cash to survive into the next week or maybe even day was a very real
concern since “In 2018, 82% of businesses that went under did so because of cash flow
problems.” (Embroker, 2020). If a startup is not even sure it will survive into the next week, why
would it spend any money on security? Being secure in and of itself will not stop a startup from
failing and may even have assisted in failure as precious cash resources are spent on
implementing security controls.
A reverse Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs factor play into why startups do not focus on
security even when they are not in the “survival mode.” When individuals are at a higher level of
Maslow's hierarchy, they will resist moving down the pyramid. When a high-tech startup is
successful; and is riding the wave of success, they live at the top of Maslow's hierarchy. They are
part of a team with a strong mission (Belonging), they feel good about themselves because of

their success (Self Esteem), and they can create and innovate (Self Actualization). When the

Fu

ll

topic of security is brought up, that pushes them down the pyramid and is no longer fun, since
now they need to think about the bad things that could happen to the company, product, or

ns

employees. Additionally, a bad enough security breach could threaten the survival of the

20

In addition to the factors related to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, another main factor

©

20

influences the focus of a startup relative to security. This factor relates to how much the
customers of that company care about security. Based on Vanessa’s experience, consumers
generally do not care about security as much as enterprise customers. If a business will be
successful with their customers, they need to focus on their customers’ care.
Generally, consumers don’t focus on security itself but care more about issues of privacy.
Based on Vanessa’s observations and experiences, consumers’ security and privacy maturity has
grown significantly over the last ten years. She believes a major contributor to that maturity has
been the very public and prevalent news on large data breaches. There seems to be weekly news
on television related to security or some data breach. The movie "The Great Hack" brought to the
public the very troubling nature of how data can be used to manipulate the outcomes of public
elections. The average consumer is much more aware of how their data can be used for identity

theft and how they can be influenced through online channels. Despite this new awareness,

Fu

ll

Vanessa still believes consumers are motivated by the price, functionality, and convenience of
most products and services and not as focused on the product or service’s security. For these

ns

reasons, companies focused on the consumer segment have fewer expectations relative to

et

ai

security and, therefore, will most likely focus less on it as a priority. This reality will change over

rR

time and more will be required by companies in terms of security when operating in the
consumer space. At some point, US will adopt a national privacy law similar to GDPR, and

ut

those that only deal with the consumer space.

ho

elements of security, as they relate to privacy, will be mandated for all companies, including

,A

Enterprise customers have a completely different set of expectations relative to security.

te

Their reputation with their customers is at stake if they choose to operate with subpar security

itu

practices. They are also driven by compliance with regulations and laws within the industry

st

vertical in which they operate. An enterprise may choose not to do business with a startup that

In

has insufficient security controls and maturity. As a startup focused on the enterprise space,

NS

security is a critical element of success built in from the start.

SA

For the reasons noted above, being focused on survival and being consumed by the
euphoria, some startups avoid spending time on security and end up inadvertently orchestrating

Th

e

their demise. There are well-documented instances of startups who failed due to security
missteps:

•

Code Spaces, which was founded in 2007, closed its doors in 2014 after an AWS instance
breach. (Mimosa, Michael, 2014).

MyBizHomePage was shut down after numerous cyberattacks by a disgruntled former
CTO against the company’s website. (Pro OnCall Technologies, 2014).

•

Distribute.IT, a domain registrar and hosting, company sustained a cyberattack that
forced them out of business in 2011. (Connolly, Bryon, and Gardiner, Bonnie, 2015)
Additionally, to the psychological challenge of not wanting to deal with security, the

security team is then challenged by seeing the risks present in their company and addressing
them. Either they were ignored, resourced constrained, or buried in the organization where they
cannot be heard. The one team that can help the organization is essentially neutralized and
ignored.

4. Research: What Founders Say

et

Vanessa interviewed six CEO/Founders from various verticals, including hospitality services,

rR

security, learning, and services/consulting. Five of these companies were pre-series B in the

ho

funding process, less than seven years old, and had less than 100 employees. Through the rest of

ut

this paper, she will refer to these five companies as the target group. One of the companies was

,A

16 years old and backed by private equity. She decided to talk to this more mature company

te

founder compared to the other five companies and will refer to this as the control group or

itu

company. She conducted hour-long interviews with each of the CEO/Founder with a

st

questionnaire located in Appendix A.

In

These interviews took place during the Covid-19 crisis, and for some of the companies,

NS

these impacts were quite dramatic, including having to layoff significant portions of their
employee base. This crisis seemed to have crystalized priorities for these leaders and turned out

SA

to be good timing in testing Vanessa’s assumptions relative to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.

e

When asked how much the leaders thought about security when they first founded the

Th

company, three out of the five target group companies did not focus on security. The two

20

companies who did focus on security early did so because they knew that security would be

20

important to selling their product and building the brand reputation. The three companies’

©

priority not focused on security was on; proving out there was a market for their product/service,
getting the product to work, and plain survival. One leader commented, “My conversations were
focused on whether we would be able to keep the lights on, I can’t think about art if I don’t have
enough to eat.” Another leader commented, “Security was not top of mind; I had other shortterm goals, and gates for survival that were the priority.”
The two target group companies who did think about security early did so because they
knew their market demanded it. They would need to establish a strong brand reputation around
security to enable sales. One target group leader commented, “I focused on security early on as I
knew I wanted to sell my product to the enterprise segment right out of the gate. If I had wanted
to go business to consumer, not sure I would have thought the same way.” The other target group
leader commented, “I knew we had to prioritize security due to reputational issues, but pressure

from the investors was forcing us to be lean, we needed to be secure but had to be practical on

Fu

ll

what we did relative to security." So even though these target group leaders focused on security,
they mainly did it to enable sales and drive revenue.

ns

The next relevant question was focused on how the target group leaders talk to their

et

ai

employees about security. The importance of this question goes to the point of establishing

rR

culture and values around security early. Two of the target group companies did not have a
strong emphasis on security when talking to their teams. When they did talk to their teams, it was

ho

more around compliance and some basic best practices. One target group leader commented,

ut

"The Sales team in the company did not care about security. Security wasn't completely off the

,A

radar, but because our customers (consumer-focused company) didn't care, we just did what

te

others in our space did to meet the minimum requirements."

itu

Three of the target group companies did take a stronger approach to communicating with

st

employees. One leader commented, "I told the team if we want to do this then we need to do this,

In

we need to earn the business and security was a requirement.” This same leader commented that

NS

it was not easy to set the tone, especially early in the company, asking himself, “if spending

SA

money on security was the right thing to do right now?” Another leader commented, “Security,
privacy, and confidentiality were a cornerstone for the company from the beginning to build an

Th

e

effective brand.” The leader commented that because of establishing these values, she was able
to attract security talent easier. Presently in her company, she commented, “I talk about security

20

like it is everyone’s job. I frequently talk about it on weekly calls, and there is high

©

20

accountability around it in terms of each employee doing their jobs. You need to practice what
you preach, and it is a topic for all employee reviews.”
The control group company had a much more mature approach to the culture, as would be
expected. This leader commented, "I drive accountability to everyone. I help employees
understand how important security is by bringing real-life examples to the team and discussing
those examples in stand-ups. Then I invest in training and give people rewards and recognition
for the desired behavior. I have established a culture of constant learning around security, not
based on punitive action when mistakes are made. It has taken me two years to develop the
culture around security." This comment establishes the challenges around building a culture of
security, and for many startups, it is just too early to have the culture take root to the extent it
needs to be established.

The third relevant question that Vanessa discussed was the priority customers placed on

Fu

ll

security and how that has changed over time. Two of the target group companies started in the
consumer space and then pivoted to the enterprise space. Their experience considerably varied

ns

when working with Consumers versus the enterprise. One leader commented, "Security was not

et

ai

something they (consumers) talked about." A security services company’s leaders noted,

rR

"Consumers were hard to convince on security. There were lot of hand-holding in convincing. It
was a huge hurdle, even if you could demonstrate experiences they had in losses due to a lack of

ho

security." As these two companies pivoted to the enterprise space, their experiences and

ut

expectations relative to security changed, and privacy seemed to take a more prominent role. One

,A

of the leaders commented, "Security expectations are ever-changing, GDPR is taking a top

te

priority for us. We will need to stay up to date on security challenges and learn from others." The

itu

other leader commented, "COVID has changed everything, privacy events have driven questions

st

around security. People don’t understand security, as privacy is more relatable.”

In

When asking the control group company about the priority of security with her customers;

NS

the leader commented, "The priority has changed over the past decade. In the beginning, we

SA

focused on basic security controls, and customers gave their suppliers the benefit of the doubt.
Now customers expect security as a baseline. Startups still have not caught up with the fact that

Th

e

customers expect security now. In her observations, later-stage startups are thinking more about
security today than they did previously.”

20

Relative to the question, “was there a pivotal event that shifted their priority of security and

©

20

the support they received around security”, four out of the five target group companies said large
enterprise deal was a pivotal point and was a catalyst for a shift and focus around security.
“When we first talked to Walmart, they had a ton of questions around security, and this helped
me realize (as the leader), we didn't know what we were talking about relative to security. I
decided to dedicate someone to security as a result of that experience." Another leader
commented that security requirements from prospective enterprise customers forced the
processes to change at his company. "I only started thinking about it when it came to enterprise
sales. SLA requirements around penetration tests, questionnaires, security scorecards. The shift
was customer-driven."
The role of the Board/Investors relative to security was the next relevant question. Vanessa

asked how that role has changed from the early phase of the company till now. Of the five target

ts

Ri

gh

A Startups Guide to Implementing a Security Program | 11

group companies, only one company said the Board/Investors asked about security, "They asked

Fu

ll

about SOC2 certification to enable sales, I also got a sense that they were concerned about risk
mitigation." Some other interesting quotes from the leaders included, "The Board only focused

ns

on revenue and executing the plan,"; "Product marketing fit and raising money were the

et

ai

important topics, sometimes hiring,"; "Investors see security as a necessary evil." Even in the

rR

present day, the Board still had little to no interest in security. One target group company that
had early interest from the Board continues to discuss security with the Board, "I produce regular

ho

security updates, we think more about risk and they want to see the due diligence around

ut

security, they want to hear about issues and what is being done to address the issues." Another

,A

target group leaders noted, “Models and pressures from LPs drive VC and Institutional Investors.

te

Their push is to have companies grow and not focus on security.”

itu

This lack of interest/involvement around security by the Board/Investors produces major

st

conflicts for a leader who does want to drive a priority and focus around security. As one leader

In

commented, "The Board had zero to say about security, anyone investing in a business model

NS

that is direct to consumers has no clue on security. They had no real appreciation for the work

SA

needed to establish a consumer brand with security. They consistently challenged my focus on
security." How does a startup leader place the right priority or resources around security if not

Th

e

supported by the Board/Investors?
In asking the leaders around priority and how it was set relative to security, there were

20

various responses and approaches. One leader described his priorities in this way, “My priorities

©

20

are business focused: generating revenue, validating the solution, raising money, and meeting
requirements of my customers." Another leader had a very hands-off approach to security, “My
CTO handles all the security priorities, I trust him and his decisions, I have a lot of confidence in
him.”.
When Vanessa asked the target group how they determine how many resources to allocate
to security, none had a structured approach to this decision. The leaders’ following statements
reflect this conclusion: "There is no process or approach in place. Right now, I just try to
optimize the money spent and keep it to a minimum. Every time we turn around, there is a new
compliance framework to comply to; this burden is a big challenge for the future.”; “I rely on the
team to do the right thing and have the right plans.”; “There is no firm metric on security spend.
The biggest challenge is the competition for security resources and the high salaries of security

professionals. I also need to control the sprawl of tools and applications.” Unlike the target group

Fu

ll

companies, the control group company did have a specific number, which was tied to a percent
of R&D spend.

ns

Finally, Vanessa asked the target group what they viewed as the key to their success relative

et

ai

to security in the future. One leader in the target group commented that she was not thinking

rR

about security; she was thinking about survival (the company just went through a layoff due to
COVID). Therefore, this reinforces Vanessa’s earlier points about Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

ho

and this leader being in the survival mode and not thinking about security at all. Other leaders

ut

highlighted the need to continue funding security, baking security early in the culture, and

,A

ensuring the culture doesn't take short cuts. One leader emphasized not turning a blind eye to

te

things, not in their control, be realistic to what is going on and find solutions to the challenges.

itu

The control group leader commented, "I need to hire people who know more than I do about

st

security; are connected to the right networks; leverage all the resources I have including the

In

Board; being humble and making sure I always connect security to the strategic company

SA

NS

priorities."

Th

e

5.0 Process and Controls Recommendations

20

Implementing the right set of security measures within a startup is a delicate balance

20

between minimizing risk and optimizing spend. Often Vanessa has heard those less

©

knowledgeable in the security space minimize the complexity of the security challenges.
Purchasing one particular tool is not going to solve the complex challenge of security. Security is
far more than a tool; it is a mindset, a culture, a set of values, processes, skilled people, and
obviously, technology. Founders must think about each of these areas when addressing the future
security maturation of their companies. Vanessa has noted the general cost estimate gauged by
high, medium, and low investment rating at the end of each of these recommendations.

5.1

Culture/Setting the tone
The establishment of a startup is exciting; the founders are immersed in self-actualization

at the top of the pyramid. They are optimistic and wondering if they are starting the next big

thing that will change the world or a unicorn that will bring them incredible wealth and financial
culture, and it is the least expensive point to begin introducing security.

Fu

ll

independence. This is the phase of the company where security should be introduced into the

ns

In defining the tone around security in the company, there are a few important data points

et

ai

that must be understood in establishing whether your company primarily serves the enterprise

rR

segment or the Consumer segment. If your company primarily serves the enterprise segment,
security will likely be an important element of selling into that segment. As was evidenced in the

ho

research, Vanessa did with the Founders; most remarked that the turning point for them was

ut

trying to meet the security requirements of the potential enterprise customers. It will be

,A

important to establish a strong brand that is associated with security if you want to be successful

te

in the enterprise space.

itu

If the product or service is targeted at the consumer segment, whether security will be

st

important to your customer depends on the product or service. For example, if you are selling a

In

Fintech service to consumers to help them consolidate debt, then security will likely be

NS

important. However, if you are selling a new type of sports clothing, security might not be as

SA

important to the customer in forming a perception of the brand. Again, as noted in the interviews
with Founders, while security may not have been a concern of consumers, privacy is a concern of

Th

e

consumers. Therefore, the principles of privacy (which include security requirements) should be

©

20

20

a priority and something to emphasize in the culture of the company.
Cost: Low. The Founder needs to take time to talk to the team and establish the values of

the organization.

5.2

Governance
Why should a startup need governance? Governance can be a complex and heavyweight

process in larger and mature organizations. Vanessa would recommend a much lighter weight
approach to governance in a startup. The main reason she recommends having a governance
process in a startup is similar to recommendations by several of the founders she interviewed;
you want to build security in early.
Governance is a set of processes and approaches to assist with defining risk tolerance, managing
risk, sorting out roles and responsibilities, generating policies, establishing priorities, and

resourcing the priorities properly. This sounds like a lot of work, but it can be achieved in a very

Fu

ll

efficient manner. Vanessa recommends initially establishing a monthly meeting with the right
attendees, including the Founder/CEO, head of technology, a key security resource, and legal if

ns

you have in-house legal. This small group will discuss current security risks, the acceptability of

et

ai

those risks, and, if not acceptable, what will be done about those risks. This group can also

rR

discuss current customer security/privacy requirements and how those will be prioritized. These
meetings should have documented minutes that can be used to demonstrate a level of governance

ut

ho

to potential auditors.

,A

Cost: Low. Founder should ensure these meetings happen and should be facilitated by them or

itu

another strong leader.

Minimizing the creation of technical debt

In

st

5.3

NS

When a company is innovating and growing fast, short cuts are taken. There is never time

SA

to do it completely right, especially early in the company, when there are minimal resources
available, and they must be focused on the highest value work. Unfortunately, the attitude, “we

Th

e

can fix that later” can have very costly and damaging impacts on the company in the future. This
accumulated short cut decision making leads to a dangerous inefficiency within the business

20

termed “technical debt.” Technical debt can take on many forms, including sub-optimal software

©

20

architecture, poor asset management, lack of scalable processes, unmanaged access control, and
security vulnerabilities. According to Dag Liodden (Firstmark, 2018), there are three reasons for

technical debt:
1. Deliberate technical debt- technical decisions made to reduce time to market.
2. Accidental/outdated design tech debt- system evolution and requirements changes cause
the original design to no longer appropriate.
3. Bit rot technical debt – numerous patches/updates done by different people who don’t

If left unresolved and unmitigated, technical debt can become the greatest risk to the

Fu

ll

company. Some of the most pernicious technical debt comes when the fundamental architecture
of the product presents serious security vulnerabilities, and the only way to address the

ns

vulnerabilities is to completely re-architect the product. This remediation effort could be so

et

ai

great; the company may not be able to afford the resolution of the security issues. The lack of

rR

remediation will result in an inherently insecure product, with the only recourse being to
implement sometimes costly mitigating controls to lessen the security risk.

ho

The Founder must ensure that they are looking at decisions from a medium/long term

ut

perspective. They must weigh out the risks of accepting technical debt with meeting deadlines

,A

and other revenue-generating activities. The more successful the company becomes, the more

te

critical sound decision-making in this area becomes. If the Founder continues to take on risk

itu

related to the technical debt, it could come back to hurt the company later. As one of the

In

st

interview candidates noted, “It’s a lot easier to struggle now (with security) than suffer later.”

NS

Cost: Medium to High. The Founder should keep track of the risks taken and have a plan to

SA

address those risks at some point. These risks can be discussed in the governance meetings.

Investing in security resources

Th

20

At some point, a startup will realize they need a dedicated security resource(s) to focus on

©

20

security. This realization will likely be driven by either a security incident or a customer request.
Most startups Vanessa has dealt with, were driven to hire security resources through the
questions or concerns expressed by a potential or existing customer. As one target group leaders
noted above, “It wasn’t till the Walmart deal that I decided to dedicate resources to security.”
The enterprise customers are most likely to drive this requirement as their standards for security
are much higher than the startup likely has for themselves.
During the vendor vetting process by the enterprise customer, they will ask the startup
numerous security and compliance questions. Questionnaires from the Financial Services sector
can be quite onerous, some exceeding 50 pages of questions. It is usually at that point that most
startups realize they need some help with security, and they need to hire someone. Who is hired

as a security leader will be largely dependent on the items Vanessa previously discussed,

Fu

ll

including culture and the amount of technical debt in the company.

When Vanessa asks startups what they are looking for in a security leader, she hears

ns

many requirements, including someone versed in technology, communicates well, can talk with

et

ai

the Board, can inspire people, and can talk to customers and help with sales. There are very few

rR

individuals that meet all these requirements, and if they were found, the startup probably would
not be able to afford them. According to Salary.com, the median salary plus bonus for CISOs in

ho

the US is $276,000 (not including benefits) (Salary.com, 2020). In Vanessa’s experience, top

ut

security engineers and architects can range between $170k- 230k/year.

,A

A critical decision a startup must make is when to hire security resources and specifically

te

what type of resources to hire. Vanessa recommendation around security hiring for a startup
If the company has a large percentage of developers and the company is primarily a

st

•

itu

depends on a few factors noted below:

In

software product serving the enterprise space, she would recommend hiring two people to

NS

focus on security. The first person would be a developer with a strong security skill set,

SA

someone who could evangelize and educate the rest of the developer community relative
to security. The second person should be strong in the Compliance and Privacy space and

Th

e

will interface with customers and prospects to address their concerns around compliance

20

and security. This second person will also help the company achieve compliance
certifications mandated by the enterprise customer.

©

20

•

If the company is mainly focused on the Consumer space, she would recommend hiring
one resource who is strong in the Compliance and Privacy space. She would also
recommend working with a security consultant (outsource) to perform any technical
security work needed, such as penetration tests.

Cost: High. Founders selling into the enterprise space must invest in security early.

A Startups Guide to Implementing a Security Program | 17

If the startup is focused on selling to the enterprise space, there will be numerous

Fu

ll

compliance certifications required by the customers depending on customer verticals. Below are
Financial services: FFIEC standards and guidance

•

Healthcare: HIPAA and HiTRUST

•

Biopharma: CFR part 11

•

Federal Government: FedRAMP and NIST 800-53

ho

rR

et

ai

•

ns

some examples of vertical industry requirements:

Obtaining certifications present a real cost to startups, and there should be a solid strategy around

,A

ut

which certifications to pursue. Costs include new processes, tools, and auditor/certification fees.
Vanessa would recommend that a startup look at the following certifications and prioritize

itu

•

te

compliance to those compliance frameworks:

Service Organization Control- SOC 1 and SOC 2. Enterprise customers ask to see the

In

st

SOC reports routinely. Startups should prioritize this as one of the first certification
efforts they pursue.

ISO 27001. As an international standard, ISO 27001 is helpful if the business is done

NS

•

SA

globally. Actual certification at the early stage is not recommended, but aligning the

e

security program to the framework would be important.
GDPR and ISO 27701 for Privacy

•

Payment Card Industry (PCI), if the startup accepts or processes credit cards.

20

20

Th

•

Cost: Medium-High. The Founder should help the organization focus relative to compliance
certifications. If the startup works across verticals, this focus will be even more important. It can
be tempting to commit to a customer prospect as the focus will be on the potential revenues and
not the costs related to the compliance effort.

5.6

Board management
The Founder must work with the Board members 1 on 1 and outside of the actual Board

meeting to evangelize her/his priorities around security. There will likely be a component of the
education of the Board member in these conversations. Finding a Board ally in the security
journey will be critical to generate the support the Founder will need to execute on their plans.

6.0 Key Technical Controls

ai

Startups need to implement some basic level of technical security controls, especially in

rR

et

light of the challenging threat environment in which they all operate. To do this effectively,
investors need to support the implementation of basic security controls. Contrary to the research

ho

found in the interviews where investors had little interest in security, Vanessa believes investors

ut

should view these controls as protecting their investments. Protecting intellectual property and

te

funds on security should be prioritized.

,A

customer information should become an imperative of investors, and spending some level of

itu

Determining what is the right level of funds to invest in security is the challenging part. A

st

majority of the Founders interviewed (5 out of 6) did not have a specific way to measure or

In

determine if they were investing the right amount of resources into security. This is not just a

NS

challenge for startups, but it is also a challenge for mature public companies. It is particularly

SA

challenging for startups as cash is a precious resource that must be managed carefully; the very
survival of the company depends on it.

Th

e

Vanessa believes the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls (Appendix B) is a

practical framework to utilize when deciding which security controls to implement. The current

20

version of CIS Controls, version 7.1, encompasses a concept of Implementation Groups (IGs).

©

20

Implementation groups outline a phased approach to implementing the 20 control areas based on
the maturity and resources available to your organization to devote to security.
Before analyzing these recommendations and offering thoughts on key controls for a
startup, Vanessa would like to make a few foundational notes relative to technology and its use
in a startup:
•

Leverage Cloud and SaaS applications as a priority, avoid on-prem systems as
much as possible.

•

Leverage the security tools available on the Cloud provider when possible.

•

With a high concentration of Cloud and SaaS applications, ensure that there is a
strong skill set in the company to manage these suppliers effectively.

While there are many nice tools available to manage Governance, Compliance,

rR

and Risk (GRC), a simple excel spreadsheet or google sheet is adequate to

manage GRC in a startup.

Assuming the foundational elements noted above, Vanessa would recommend that the

itu

CIS control focus areas for a startup in the chart below. The CIS Control framework includes

In

st

many of these as a part of Implementation Group 1, which are suited for “small to medium-sized
companies with limited IT and cybersecurity expertise to dedicate toward protecting IT assets

NS

and personnel.” For any that are noted below that are not a part of IG1, Vanessa distinguished

those with an asterisk in the sub-control. Additionally, she has omitted some of the IG1 controls

To summarize, some key tools will help a startup accomplish many of these security controls:
•

Cloud Directory provider

•

Identity and access management cloud solution

•

Endpoint management tool

•

Endpoint advanced malware tool

•

DNS Filtering tool

•

Log collection and correlation tool

Vanessa recommends focusing on this toolset primarily as a first phase of building technical
controls.

7.0 Working with Startups (Note to Large Enterprises)

The primarily benefit startups offer larger enterprise customers is innovation. They

ns

deliver new products and services to an enterprise that either is not focused on that innovation or

ai

may not have the capabilities to deliver that innovation. The startup community allows larger

rR

et

enterprises to offer differentiation (generate new revenue), disrupt inefficient processes (cost
savings), or deliver a better customer experience (maintain revenue). An enterprise interested in

ho

the product or service the startup has to offer would have a vested interest in their success. There

ut

are specific steps an enterprise can take to help ensure the success of a startup they want to

,A

leverage.

te

The first important element of ensuring success is implementing the right supplier risk

itu

management process. Many large enterprises have an extensive supplier risk management

st

process comprised of questionnaires, evidence gathering, contract negotiations, and audits

In

(remote and on-site). When dealing with a startup, the enterprise should consider the amount of

NS

time and resources their supplier risk management process will take from the startup. Vanessa

SA

recommends that enterprises develop a scaled-down approach for their processes when dealing
with the startup. The scaled-down process should omit questions that obviously would not apply

Th

e

to a company composed of less than 100 people. The decision on which questions to omit will
depend on the vertical and the risk tolerance of the enterprise.

20

The second important element is to approach the relationship as a true partnership with a

©

20

legitimate interest in seeing the startup be successful. A large enterprise has a lot of resources
and experiences that can be useful to the startup, including providing them input on their
roadmaps, offering to introduce them to key subject matter experts in the enterprise who could
share their approach or solution on a particular initiative, allowing the startup to leverage the
enterprise logo from a marketing perspective, and doing webinars in conjunction with the startup
to highlight use cases.
Keep in mind the reason an enterprise chooses to do business with a startup is that they
have some unique value to bring to the enterprise, not because they have the same level of
maturity in security and other processes that the enterprise has in place. There will need to be
some level of increased risk tolerance by the enterprise in exchange for innovation.

8.0 Conclusion

ns

Founders have the difficult challenge of balancing the survival of the company with the

ai

needs and demands of their customer base. They often do not receive the support of their

et

investors, and this compounds their challenges relative to security. While there are differences in

rR

customer expectations depending on whether the customer is in the enterprise or consumer space,

ho

the expectations around security and privacy are continuing to grow over time.

ut

Interviews with Founders/CEOs have reinforced the hypothesis Vanessa laid out at the

,A

beginning of the paper. Startups are primarily focused on surviving, and not focused on security
and when they were focused on security, it was to drive revenue, which is survival. Knowing that

itu

te

they need to survive, and security is a key element of that survival, founders need a set of

In

st

foundational controls and processes on which to focus. These focus areas include:
Setting the right tone and investing in the culture of security.

•

Putting in place a basic Governance structure and associated processes.

•

Minimizing technical debt and actively managing that debt.

•

Investing in the right people.

•

Focusing on a limited set of compliance certifications.

•

Actively managing the Board/Investors.

•

Implementing a key set of technical controls.

e

NS

•

Enterprises rely on the innovation of the startup community, and they also must assist in
their success. Startups will need the support of the enterprise space to deliver the security they
demand.
