Security and Related Concerns in Cloud

There are a number of security issues/concerns associated with Cloud computing. Gartner report specifies the following
seven security issues in Cloud computing.
Privileged User Access : Cloud computing allows the processing of the confidential data of user by personnel
outside the organization, so non-employees could possibly have full access to it. Consumer should ask providers to
supply specific information on the hiring and oversight of privileged administrators, and the controls over their
access.
Regulatory Compliance: Customers are ultimately responsible for the security and integrity of their own data, even
when it is held by a service provider. Traditional service providers are subjected to external audits and security
certifications.

Data Location : When a customer uses the Cloud, customer probably would not know exactly where his data is
hosted. It is required to ask providers if they will commit to storing and processing data in specific jurisdictions, and
whether they will make a contractual commitment to obey local privacy requirements on behalf of their customers.
Data Segregation : Data in the Cloud is typically in a shared environment alongside data from other customers.
Encryption is effective but is not a cure-all. Encryption accidents can make data totally unusable, and even normal
encryption can complicate availability.
Recovery : Even if the consumer does not know where his data is, a Cloud provider should tell to his consumer what
will happen to data and service in case of a disaster. Any offering that does not replicate the data and application
infrastructure across multiple sites is vulnerable to a total failure.
Investigative Support : Cloud services are especially difficult to investigate, because logging and data for multiple
customers may be co-located and may also be spread across an ever-changing set of hosts and data centers.
Long-term Viability : Ideally, Cloud computing provider will never go broke or get acquired and swallowed up by a
larger company. But the consumer must ensure that his data will remain available even after such an event. It is
essential to know from providers how he would get his data back and if it would be in a format that could import into
a replacement application.
