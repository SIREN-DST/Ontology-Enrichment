Dell Encryption
Today, organizations need to secure both the endpoints and the
data on them, while supporting workforce mobility. Traditional
encryption solutions are limited and restrictive in terms of
deployment, extent of endpoint coverage and user performance.
Traditional encryption solutions attempt to address these needs,
but most are diffcult to deploy and manage, lack coverage for all
endpoints and reduce performance for users.
Dell Encryption Enterprise offers options with its ﬂexible encryption
technology such as data-centric policy based approach as well a
Full Disk Encryption approach to protect data. The solution is for
designed for:
• Ease of Deployment
• End-user transparency
• Hassle-free compliance
• Ease of management with single console
Dell Encryption is a ﬂexible suite of enhanced security solutions
that include File Based encryption, Full Disk Encryption, enhanced
centralized management of native encryption (Microsoft BitLocker
and Mac FireVault) and protection of data on external media, selfencrypting drives and mobile devices.
Dell Encryption Enterprise
Dell Encryption Enterprise allows IT to easily enforce encryption
policies, whether the data resides on the system drive or external
media and doesn’t require end user intervention.
A perfect solution for mixed-vendor environments,
Encryption Enterprise enables:
• Automatic deployment and provisioning when factory-installed
on Dell commercial devices
• Deployment in less than 30 minutes in VMware environments
with Wizard-based installation and fully integrated database
and key management
• No required defragmenting before encryption
• System disk and external media encryption in a single solution
• Choose software Full Disk Encryption or File Based Encryption
• Easy compliance management and auditing with one- touch
compliance policy templates, remote management and quick
system recovery
• Integration with existing processes for authentication,
patching and more
• Sales and support for your hardware and security solutions
from one source
• Encryption of all data, except fles essential to booting the
operating system or Full Disk Encryption, depending on
your preference
• Enhanced port control system to prevent data leakage
• Ability to encrypt based on end user profles, data and groups
within your organization
• Centralized management of all encryption policies,
including self-encrypting drives, Full Disk Encryption and
Microsoft BitLocker encryption
• Enhanced authentication for OPAL standard devices, including
single sign-on to OS through Pre-Boot Authentication (PBA)
using smart cards and passwords


Dell Security Management
Server Virtual
With simplifed deployment utilizing a purpose-built virtual
management server and console app for VMware, Dell has raised
the bar on how easily and quickly our endpoint encryption solution,
Dell Encryption, can be up and running in most mid-sized enterprise
environments with up to 3,500 endpoints.
The Dell Security Management Server Virtual makes Dell
Encryption the perfect choice for SMEs that already have
VMware solutions and are looking for a simple, rapidly deployable
management platform for their encryption and authentication
policies. It contains all of the same features and benefts of the
standard Server, including full support for the broad range of
encryption coverage available for laptops, desktops and
external media.
Managing Self-Encrypting Drives with Dell
Encryption Enterprise
Organizations using self-encrypting drives (SEDs) also require
careful management if they are to be effective in reducing the risk
of data loss and meeting their audit and compliance goals.
Dell Encryption Enterprise provides a centralized, secure
management for self-encrypting drives across your organization,
both local and remote. All policy, authentication, management
tasks, storing and retrieval of encryption keys are available from
a single console, reducing the work of keeping critical data safe
and reducing the risk that systems are unprotected in the event of
loss or unauthorized access. Most importantly – the management
for OPAL standard devices is fully integrated in the same data
protection platform as File-Based encryption, Microsoft BitLocker,
removable media encryption.
Remote management capabilities include the ability to:
• Disable logins and wipe user cache to protect data and ensure
that only an authorized administrator can re-enable access to
the protected data
• Disable the device to prevent any user from logging into the
system until an unlock command is sent
• Enable the device so users can login to use the SED
• Perform a remote and automatic unlock on the disk, enabling
administrators to perform essential tasks such as patching
without needing to leave the device unlocked overnight
• Deliver full pre-boot authentication including authentication
using Active Directory
• Set policies for automated response to attacks
(including brute-force attacks)


Managing Full Disk Encryption with Dell
Encryption Enterprise
Organizations using Full-Disk Encryption, can 24x7 protect
sensitive data that resides on PC and other endpoints. Dell
Enterprise Encryption’s latest feature, Full-Disk Encryption helps
effectively meet the demanding needs of data protection. Full Disk
Encryption enables the following:
• Complements our current encryption offering and
makes our encryption solution one of the most robust in
the industry
• Delivers enterprise class pre-boot authentication for
enterprise deployment
• Uses TPM to protect keys which prevents any attacker from
removing the hard drive from the platform and performing an
ofﬂine attack of obfuscated keys stored on the drive
• Encrypts all local hard drives within a simplifed deployment
